The program in C++ is designed to calculate the sum of all even numbers in a given range. The user enters two numbers, and if the first is greater than the second, the program automatically swaps them using std::swap to ensure the correct order of the boundaries.

The calculation is performed by the function even_sum, which is implemented recursively. It checks each number: if it is even — adds it to the sum and moves to the next even one; if it is odd — skips it and moves further.

For example, for the numbers 3 and 10 the program will sum 4, 6, 8 and 10, obtaining the result 28. This approach demonstrates the use of recursion instead of loops, automatic processing of range boundaries, and the work with conditional constructions in C++.
